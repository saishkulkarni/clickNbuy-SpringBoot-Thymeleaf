Interview Explanation:
The clickNbuy project is a Spring Boot + Thymeleaf based e-commerce application. 
I structured it with layered architecture: controllers delegate to services, which talk to repositories. 
For UI, Thymeleaf templates render inventory, cart, checkout pages.
For security, I used Spring Security to enforce authentication and role-based access (customer vs admin). 
Passwords are hashed. I guard endpoints so only admins can access product management.
A key feature is integration: I used JavaMailSender to send confirmation emails, password reset tokens, order summaries. 
I integrated Twilio to send SMS/OTP for user verification (e.g. registration or password change). For payments, I connected Razorpay so users can pay for orders, verify payments, and handle callbacks/webhooks.
I’ve handled edge cases: what if payment fails, or OTP expires, or email sending fails (retry or fallback). I also externalized configurations like API keys, used profiles for dev/prod. 
If time allows, I’d like to show you how I ensured transaction integrity around order + payment flows to avoid inconsistent states.”

S – Situation
I wanted to build a full-fledged e-commerce web app to strengthen my backend and integration skills. The goal was to create something close to a real business scenario — secure user handling, product management, and live payment/notification integrations.

T – Task
My task was to design and implement an end-to-end e-commerce system using Spring Boot and Thymeleaf, with proper authentication, role management, and external integrations for email, SMS (Twilio), and online payments (Razorpay).
I also wanted to ensure it’s production-ready — secure, modular, and scalable.

A – Action
Backend: Built a layered Spring Boot architecture (Controller → Service → Repository) using JPA for ORM.
Frontend: Used Thymeleaf templates for product listings, carts, and checkout pages.
Security: Implemented Spring Security for authentication and role-based access (Admin vs Customer). Passwords are encrypted with BCrypt.
Integrations:
Configured JavaMailSender for sending order confirmations and password reset links.
Integrated Twilio API for OTP verification during registration and sensitive actions.
Implemented Razorpay SDK to process online payments and verify payment signatures securely.
Transactions: Ensured order creation and payment processing occur in a consistent transaction — rolling back if payment fails.
Error Handling: Added global exception handling, input validation, and fallback messages for failed services.
Deployment: Externalized all API keys and configs through environment properties for security.

R – Result
The project now functions as a complete mini-ecommerce platform where users can browse, add to cart, make secure payments, and receive email/SMS confirmations.

It helped me gain hands-on experience with real-world integrations, improved my understanding of Spring Security and RESTful design, and strengthened my ability to handle external APIs and transaction consistency in enterprise apps.
